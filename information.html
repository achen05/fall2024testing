                <p>An early obsession with art and media formed my particular understanding of reality as a collage of language: words, images, and artifacts that communicated stories, ideas, and arguments. I grew attuned to languageâ€™s profound power in shaping how we understand and act within the world, and this sensitivity instilled in me a deep sense of ethics in handling how it was used. As a graphic designer, my practice is a constant and careful balancing act: to mold the way we see the world through language while also being mindful of its inherent political, social, and cultural consequences.</p>
